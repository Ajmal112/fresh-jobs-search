# Fresh Jobs Search

A website that helps users find fresh job opportunities by aggregating results from top job websites. This project aims to solve the problem of time-consuming job searches by providing a centralized platform to access job listings based on specific search criteria.

**Note: This project is currently in the testing phase and primarily serves as a demonstration of API integration.**

## Features

- Job Search: Users can enter their desired job title, such as "software developer," and the website will fetch and display relevant job listings from various top job websites.
- Streamlined Job Hunting: By consolidating job listings from multiple sources, this website eliminates the need to manually visit each job website, saving time and effort for job seekers.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Markup language used for structuring the web pages.
- CSS: Stylesheet language used for designing the website's layout and appearance.
- JavaScript: Programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to the website.

4. The website will make API calls to top job websites and retrieve relevant job listings based on the search criteria.
5. The retrieved job listings will be displayed on the website, providing job seekers with a consolidated view of available opportunities.

## Future Enhancements
